- [ ] I want to modify the gradient progression a bit so it's more static.  earliest data is for 2003 and the most recent data is for 2025 (this year).  If I generate a map for 2003-2008, I want it to use the same colors for those years as it would if I generated a map for 2003-2025.  The year overlay should try to match the gradient of the polygons, so a 2003-2008 08-01 image should have 2008 with the color we're using for 2008, not the very red 2025 color
